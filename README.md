- Front-end: Built with React, a powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- TypeScipt: Enhances code readability, maintainability, and developer productivity by leveraging type safety features.
- Node.js: A powerful JavaScript runtime environment that forms the foundation for DevCase's server-side logic and functionalities.
